  * Incorporating the thinking, feeling, and behaving dimensions of human experience, the tenth edition of Corey's best-selling text helps you compare and contrast the therapeutic models expressed in counseling theories. Corey introduces you to the major theories (psychoanalytic, Adlerian, existential, person-centered, Gestalt, reality, behavior, cognitive-behavior, family systems, feminist, postmodern, and integrative approaches) and demonstrates how each theory can be applied to two cases ('Stan' and 'Gwen'). He shows you how to apply theories in practice, and helps you learn to integrate the theories into an individualized counseling style. New learning objectives identify key aspects of each theory and focus your study.
